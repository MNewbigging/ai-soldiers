Thoughts:
- soldier AI will differ, but animations will be the same
- create a base class we can both extend that handles all the animation setup
- add in german soldier model and create equal setup, use extended class


- add in german soldier and gun
- copy over the same idle anim and goal
- create a flat arena, using more floor textures
